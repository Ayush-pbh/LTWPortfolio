            <h3 class="sub-heading">Leadership Defined</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text">In this module I learned 3 very practical and informative definitions of <b>Leadership</b></p>
            <ul class="text">
                <li>It as the ability to recognize, attract, develop, motivate, and retain top talent. people work for people. They work for great people.</li>
                <br>
                <li>“Leadership is recognizing that we are all one, and that everyone you lead, everyone who follows you, deep down
                    inside, has the same genius, the same brilliance, the same potential for success and greatness that
                    you do. They simply need to be reminded of this fact.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>I wish I could say that you can read a textbook about leadership and then just be one, and it works, or
                    you can have a single moment and suddenly you’re a great leader, etc. I mean, I just don’t think it
                    works like that. Unfortunately, a whole combination of your genetic makeup and how you’ve been
                    nurtured throughout your whole life, together with your actual experiences in business settings, all
                    add up to make you succeed or fail, unfortunately.
                    So it does mean, I think, the very best way of becoming a great leader is by actually leading and
                    learning from the experience continuously. Of course, it would be very arrogant as well to assume
                    that anybody who, you know, where things are going okay, it’s going to stay that way. So you have to
                    be perpetually changing your own behavior set to suit the changing circumstances around you as
                    well</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">My Defination of <i>"Leadership"</i>.</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Leadership is act of constantly reminding yourself that the people working for you are as good as you and as worthy as you. You need to retain the top talent in your team, by treating them with fairness. You could only learn this by experince and example.</p>
