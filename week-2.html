            <br>
            <p class="text">As far back as I can remember I used to be a very under confident kid who knew that he will achieve something but the roadmap was clear to me. I know the roadmap is never clear to anyone at the start, but the difference between anyone else and me at that time was that I was very under confident so even if I had took a right descion any little amount of external influence could make me doubt on my desicon and at the end the finally changing it.</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p class="text">My motivation to change my current state came, after realising that I am capable of taking my own desicons the only thing I need is confidence in myself and the courage to face the consiquences that they will result in.
